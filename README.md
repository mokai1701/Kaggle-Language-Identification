# Kaggle-Language-Identification


The aim of this repository and the accompanying notebook is for the version control on a Kaggle Classification Hackathon that takes in raw text data and looks to identify and predict if a labels falls in one of the 11 South African official languages

Evaluation metric
The evaluation metric of the is classification is the F1_score, depicted with the formula below:

𝐹1=2×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙/𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
 
According to deepai.org.The F1_score is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset, and it is a way of combining the precision and recall of the model, and it is defined as the harmonic mean of the model’s precision and recall.
